## Stories
Here are three possible stories to visualize.
We can do any of them, or more than one, depending on how much time we have, and what makes for an interesting viz.

1. The alliances are breaking up.
> Show how the small parties more and more often vote against their own block, and with the other side.

2. Who supports the government?
> We have a minority government, so for each and every voting, they have to find support from at least one opposition party.
  What parties is it that normally save the government.
  -> stack graph?

3. Who votes with who? What parties vote the same?

## Media

The publication here is Expressen, one of the two big evening papers: http://www.expressen.se/
For inspiration: https://www.holderdeord.no/ “Hvem stemmer sammen på Stortinget?” = “Who votes together in Stortinget?”
They also have a Twitter-bot that tweets when a MP votes against their own party: https://twitter.com/partipisken (Partipisken = The Party Whip). It shuold be note that the party whip is traditionally stronger in Sweden than in Norway.
The who votes for whom data is here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VKpT15bXwhc-O-QrC8gIJS7KCykNdInMVLjNs2kSmLQ/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1501660703
